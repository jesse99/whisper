TYPES

E  - Enumeration type.

VARIABLES

k  - Constants (including enumeration constants)
g  - Global variables
s  - File scoped global variables
m  - Member data 
ms - Static member data

Note that all variables begin with a lower case letter.

CLASSES

I - COM interface
X - Cross-platform classes
M - Mac specific classes
W - Windows specific classes

FUNCTIONS

Create - Functions that create an object the caller must delete start with Create.
Take   - Functions that assume responsibility for deleting an object start with Take.

Handle - Functions that manage the flow of control. These functions consist
         of the code to manage the flow of control and one or more calls to 
         functions that the user can override to suit his application. These
         functions are prefaced with On. The Handle function itself will 
         rarely be overriden. An example is XControl::HandleMouseDown which 
         calls XControl::OnMouseDown.
On     - A function called by the framework or the system that the user can 
         override to suit his application. Overriding these functions is the
         principle way users adapt Whisper for their applications.

Note that all functions begin with an upper case letter.

OTHERS

Prepocessor symbols are all upper case.
Template arguments are all upper case.
