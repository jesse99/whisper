<P> Whisper is an open source, general purpose, cross platform, application framework written in C++ and targeting 
Win32 and the Mac OS. It's similar to native frameworks like MFC and PowerPlant, but better because it uses
modern C++, makes good use of abstractions, and uses design by contract. These  advantages are discussed below.


<H3>Modern C++</H3>

<P> MFC is one of the earliest C++ application frameworks and it's age is reflected in the style of C++ it's written
in. There are at least three areas where MFC's early start hurts it: exception handling, container classes, and
CObject. 

<P> MFC is still using an exception handling scheme cooked up before MSVC supported exceptions: exception objects 
are allocated on the heap and macros are used instead of the standard exception keywords. This means that 
CATCH_ALL will not catch exceptions derived from std::exception which will cause problems with using language 
features (eg dynamic_cast), the standard library (eg vector::at()), and third party libraries written in 
standard C++. It would be possible to abandon the macros, but this imposes quite a burden on client code.

<P> MFC includes two sets of container classes: the original classes which work with CObject pointers and a limited
set of integral types and slightly newer templatized versions. These classes are mostly OK, but don't come near
to matching STL for flexibility or ease of use. The classes are also incompatible with STL's algorithm library.

<P> Finally MFC is centered around an old-style single inheritance model. This is inflexible and leads designers to
push functionality upward in the class hierarchy (eg CObject includes a Serialize method which doesn't make sense
for all the objects derived from CObject (eg should CException be serializable?)). A better approach is to forego
using a base object and take advantage of multiple inheritance. 

<P> This will seem strange to many people: just about every C++ author discourages using MI, including generally
sensible people like Scott Meyers (author of the mostly excellent <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201924889/o/qid=921139624/sr=2-1/002-7781608-5107820">Effective C++</A> 
books). However the arguments they give tend to boil down to: 1) A MI design can always be rewritten using SI 2) 
Virtual base classes are evil. The first argument is a straw man: the same could be said of C versus C++, or assembler 
versus C. The second has some merit: virtual base classes are a rather horrible part of the language. However it's 
possible to get a great deal of milage out of MI without going near virtual base classes.

<P> The key is to segregate classes into two groups: the mainline classes (XWindow, XMenu, XFile, etc) which can be
either subclassed or instantiated as is and the mixin classes (eg XBroadcasterMixin, XExtensibleMixin, XIdlerMixin,
XStreamableMixin, etc) which are designed to be mixed into a mainline class. This allows for a very flexible design
and markedly increases class cohesion. For example, instead of moving broadcaster/listener (eg the Observer pattern)
or idling into a base class regardless of whether all subclasses will need it, you simply mixin whatever you need
(eg CApplication may descend from XApplication, XBroadcasterMixin, and XIdlerMixin). With just a little care
you'll never run into a diamond shaped inheritance graph so virtual base classes are never needed. (Mixin classes
are discussed in more detail in <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201408880/qid=908937827/sr=1-3/002-0033785-8771261">Taligent's Guide to Designing Programs</A> 
which I encourage everyone to read).

<P> PowerPlant is a much newer framework than MFC and feels much more modern. However it, too, uses it's own rather
lame suite of collection classes. PowerPlant does use MI, but doesn't distinguish between mainline and mixin
classes as strongly as Whisper: clients have to rely on comments to determine whether a class is intended to be
used as a mixin and the dreaded diamond-of-death is not altogether avoided (eg LAttachable is a virtual base class).

<P> As you may have guessed Whisper uses STL instead of hand rolled container classes. However i have included a number of
new STL style classes. These include XArray (2D array), XAutoPtr (replacement for std::auto_ptr that disables
copying), XCountedPtr (a smart pointer class that maintains an internal ref count to allow safe copying), XSafePtr
(a smart pointer class that gets notified when the pointee is deleted), XSparseArray (sparse 2D array implemented
using std::map), XTinyVector (std::vector subset that generates very little code), and XTree (tree structures with
arbitrary number of children). Using STL is not an unmitagated blessing. The worst problem is that current STL
implementations introduce a great deal of bloat. However this is slowly improving: on the Mac the latest MSL includes
partial specializations of list and vector for pointers. On Windows, MSVC 6's linker merges template functions when
they contain identical code.


<H3>Abstractions</H3>

<P> Whisper, MFC, and PowerPlant have different ideas on the best way to wrap a C++ class around an OS object. MFC's
classes provide essentially zero abstraction over the native OS. This can make the classes much more difficult
than they should be to use. For example, CRgn directly maps onto the Win API: there's only a single (default)
constructor, there are no operators defined (except operator== in CGdiObject which is arguably wrong since it will
check the handle instead of the contents), and return codes are used instead of exceptions. This makes even the
simplest operations involving regions quite tedious. For example:
<PRE>
   void CDirtyRects::Invalidate(const XRect& rect)
   {
      CRgn temp;
      BOOL succeeded = temp.CreateRectRgn(rect.left, rect.top, rect.right, tect.bottom);
      ThrowIf(!succeeded);
      
      int result = mDirtyRgn.CombineRgn(&mDirtyRgn, &temp, RGN_OR);
      ThrowIf(result == ERROR);
   }
</PRE>
   
<P> On the other hand, Whisper provides a better abstraction of regions making them easier and safer to use:

<PRE>
   void CDirtyRects::Invalidate(const XRect& rect)
   {
      mDirtyRgn += rect;
   }
</PRE>
   
<P> PowerPlant does a better job abstracting the OS, but unlike MFC doesn't completely wrap the OS. Many PowerPlant
classes require clients to talk directly to the OS. For example, PowerPlant includes an LFile class which is nice
because it will handle error checking and is exception safe since the destructor will close the file. However
there are no methods for seeking within the file or for doing partial reads and writes. Strangely enough, this is
a deliberate design choice: the PowerPlant designers consider it perfectly OK to provide incomplete classes forcing
clients to rummage around in the OS docs to find out which additional features are supported and to write too two
distinct interfaces.

<P> Here's an example of how MFC, PowerPlant, and Whisper look to clients. I've chosen the menu class because it's a
non-trivial class common to all three frameworks and doesn't depend on much from parent classes. To keep things
short I've stripped out everything but the initialization/destruction and getter methods. First MFC:
<PRE>
   class CMenu : public CObject
   {
   public:

   // Constructors
      CMenu();

      BOOL CreateMenu();
      BOOL CreatePopupMenu();
      BOOL LoadMenu(UINT nIDResource);
      BOOL DestroyMenu();

   // Attributes
      HMENU m_hMenu;          // must be first data member
      HMENU GetSafeHmenu() const;
      operator HMENU() const;

   // CMenuItem Operations
      UINT GetMenuItemCount() const;
      UINT GetMenuItemID(int nPos) const;
      UINT GetMenuState(UINT nID, UINT nFlags) const;
      int GetMenuString(UINT nIDItem, CString& rString, UINT nFlags) const;
      CMenu* GetSubMenu(int nPos) const;

   // Implementation
   public:
      virtual ~CMenu();
   };
</PRE>

<P> There are a number of things to note about this class: 1) The two stage construction scheme. This is annoying, but 
used throughout MFC. 2) The use of the BOOL return value. This is used to signal success or failure (the CMenuItem 
methods also use the return value for errors). 3) The public m_hMenu member. This too is rather prevalent in MFC.
4) The lack of any features beyond those provided by the OS. For example, there isn't an easy way to get the name
of the menu or the parent menu.

<P> Now PowerPlant:

<PRE>
   class   LMenu {
      friend class LMenuBar;   
      
   public:
               LMenu();
               
               LMenu(ResIDT      inMENUid);
               
               LMenu(SInt16         inMENUid,
                     ConstStringPtr inTitle,
                     bool           inAlwaysThemeSavvy = false);
               ~LMenu();
      
      MenuHandle GetMacMenuH() const           { return mMacMenuH; }
               
      ResIDT     GetMenuID() const             { return mMENUid; }
      
                  // Mapping between Command numbers and Index numbers

      CommandT   CommandFromIndex(
                     SInt16         inIndex) const;
                     
      CommandT   SyntheticCommandFromIndex(
                     SInt16         inIndex) const;
                     
      SInt16     IndexFromCommand(
                     CommandT       inCommand) const;
      
      bool       FindNextCommand(
                     SInt16&         ioIndex,
                     SInt32&         outCommand) const;
      
                  // Manipulating Items
      
      bool       ItemIsEnabled(
                     SInt16          inIndex) const;
      
      bool       IsInstalled() const           { return mIsInstalled; }
               
      bool       IsUsed() const                { return mUsed; }
      
      static MenuHandle   MakeNewMacMenu(
                           ResIDT         inMENUid,
                           ConstStringPtr inTitle = Str_Empty,
                           bool           inAlwaysThemeSavvy = false);
   };
</PRE>

<P> Again there are several items of note: 1) This class doesn't include a copy constructor or assignment operator.
However if an LMenu object is copied bad things will happen when the second object is detroyed (CMenu doesn't
have this problem because CObject disables copying). 2) ConstStringPtr is used. This is a raw Pascal string,
despite the fact the PowerPlant includes a Pascal string class. 3) There's no provision for getting the name of
the menu, the name of an item, testing for seperators, or retrieving a submenu.

<P> Now Whisper:
<PRE>
   class XMenu : public XInvariantMixin {

      typedef XInvariantMixin Inherited;

   //-----------------------------------
   //   Initialization/Destruction
   //
   public:
      virtual            ~XMenu();

   #if MAC
      explicit          XMenu(ResID id);
                        // Note that the menu must have an associated 'Rcmd' resource
                        // and every menu item must have a command.
   #endif

      explicit         XMenu(const XString& name, uint32 id = 0);
                       // Lets you build the menu from scratch. Note that menu id's are optional.
         
   private:   
                       XMenu(const XMenu& rhs);
      
            XMenu&     operator=(const XMenu& rhs);         

   //-----------------------------------
   //   API
   //
   public:
      // ----- Menu -----
            XString    GetName() const                     {return mName;}
      
            uint32     GetCount() const                    {return mMenuCommands.size();}
            
            bool       IsSubMenu() const                   {return mParent != nil;}

            bool       IsInstalled() const;
                       // Returns true if the menu is directly or indirectly installed 
                       // in the menu bar.
                     
            XMenuBar*  GetMenuBar() const;
                       // Will return nil if the menu isn't installed.
                     
            uint32     GetID() const                       {return mMenuID;}
                       // On the Mac this may not be the same as the MenuHandle's id.
         
            OSMenu     GetOSMenu() const                   {return mMenuH;}
                                       
      // ----- Generic Menu Items -----
            XString    GetName(uint32 index) const;
                       // Note that the returned string has single ampsersands removed 
                       // and double ampersands converted to single ampsersands.

      // ----- Seperators -----
            bool       IsSeperator(uint32 index) const;
            
      // ----- Menu Commands -----
            MenuCommand GetCommand(uint32 index) const;
               
      // ----- Sub-Menus -----
            bool       IsSubMenu(uint32 index) const;
      
            XMenu*     GetSubMenu(uint32 index) const;
   };
</PRE>

<P> Again there are several items of note: 1) XInvariantMixin is used to implement design by contract (see the next
section). 2) Unlike PowerPlant the explicit keyword is used to prevent an implicit conversion of an int to a menu.
3) There's no way to build a menu from a resource on Windows. This is because the Windows resource compiler is a pale
shadow of it's Mac counterpart. I'll probably change this later and use XML resources on both Mac and Windows.
4) The interface isn't constrained to that provided by the OS. Instead an attempt has been made to to provide a
sensible abstraction that is clear and easy to use. 5) Methods that may be unclear are commented. (PowerPlant also
does a fairly good job of commenting classes, but they're almost always buried in the cpp...) 


<H3>Design By Contract</H3>

<P> Most programmers today understand how useful assertions can be when writing software. However assertions have
progressed a lot beyond the days of the simple C-style assert. In particular, Betrand Meyer has thought a lot about how
assertions should be integrated into an object oriented language. He calls this <A HREF="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/contract/index.html">Design by Contract</A>.
If you're not familiar with DBC I'd heartily recommend that you check out the link above or read Meyer's book
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0136291554/qid=908937936/sr=1-1/002-0033785-8771261">Object-Oriented Software Construction</A>
which is widely considered to be a classic work on OOD. 

<P> At the root of DBC is the notion of a "contract": clients promise to correctly call a function (eg with the right
arguments) and in return the function promises to do the right thing. Since people are fallible the function should
include preconditions to assert that the client is correctly calling the function and postconditions to assert that
the function behaved correctly. Note that the function makes no attempt to code around errors in the caller: the
app may terminate, an exception may be thrown, or the app may trundle along as if nothing happened (in Whisper you
can use either of the last two in release builds).

<P> The second key component of DBC are class invariants. These are conditions that are always (externally) true. For
example, one invariant for a vector class might be that the total buffer size is always greater than or equal to the
bytes in use. The invariant should hold as soon as the constructor exits and whenever a public function is called
from outside the object (the object may temporarily fall into an invalid state while a member function executes).
Invariants have at least three uses: 1) Thinking about a class's invariant tends to clarify design issues. 2) Invariants
are useful for ensuring that objects behave as they're supposed. This is especially useful for the more complex objects.
For example, in another lifetime, I implemented a red-black tree. This is a quite complex version of a balanced tree.
Using an invariant made it much easier for me to verify that my code never veered from the constraints that make a tree
red-black. 3) Invariants allow base classes to catch improperly written subclasses. This is important because the
assumptions that underly the base class implementation are not always obvious to subclass authors.

<P> Meyer made DBC an integral part of the Eiffel language. This allowed him to implement things like allowing postconditions
access to the old values of member variables and having method overrides automatically inherit pre and postconditions.
These are nice features (especially the second), but very difficult to implement in standard C++. Whisper implements
as much of DBC as I think is practical: the PRECONDITION and POSTCONDITION macros call an Invariant() method which relies on
an XInvariantMixin class to maintain a nesting count so that the invariant is only called when a public function is
entered and exited. The macros look like this:
<PRE>
   #define   PRECONDITION(p)  ASSERT(p); \
                              const Whisper::XInvariantMixin* _object = dynamic_cast<const Whisper::XInvariantMixin*>(this); \
                              ASSERT(_object != nil); \
                              Whisper::ZCheckInvariant _check(_object)
   #define   POSTCONDITION(p) ASSERT(p)

   #define CHECK_INVARIANT    ASSERT(dynamic_cast<const XInvariantMixin*>(this) != nil); \
                              dynamic_cast<const XInvariantMixin*>(this)->Invariant
</PRE>

<P> CHECK_INVARIANT is typically only used at the end of constructors and at the start of destructors. dynamic_cast is used because
it's sometimes useful to add PRECONDITION and POSTCONDITION's to a mixin class, but XInvariantMixin cannot be mixed into a mixin
(to avoid the diamond-of-death). PRECONDITION uses a stack based object to check the invariant so that the invariant is checked
if the method exits via an exception. In release builds PRECONDITION and POSTCONDITION are equivalent to a simple ASSERT which
can be either a no-op or throw an XAssertException (a subclass of std::logic_error).

<P> PRECONDITION and POSTCONDITION are typically used in conjunction with the Template Method pattern: these are methods that
define the skeleton of an algorithm and call hook methods to perform the actual work. For example, XInputTargetMixin implements
the Chain of Responsiblity pattern. It includes a method called HandleMenuCommand which traps exceptions and calls OnMenuCommand
to give the object a chance to handle the command. If the command isn't handled the object's parent target is given a chance to
handle the command. This is often a good way to structure objects and works even better with DBC since clients should only have
to override the On methods so that the pre and postconditions in the Handle method remain undisturbed.
