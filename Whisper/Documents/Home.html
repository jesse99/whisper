	<P>Whisper is a general purpose Mac/Win32 C++ application framework. It's the successor
	to the Mac framework Raven. Like Raven Whisper is a modern framework that takes
	advantage of templates, multiple inheritance, STL, and exceptions. It's also designed
	around the notion of Design by Contract and includes numerous debugging tools.
	
	There are a number of things I want to achieve with Whisper:
		<UL> 
		<LI>I want to make it as easy as possible to write cross platform apps. Ideally this 
		would involve merely a recompile. (At my last company we essentially achieved this 
		using a more specialized framework than Whisper).</LI>
		
		<LI>I don't want to slight either platform: Whisper should be just as attractive to
		a Windows programmer as to a Mac programmer.</LI>
		
		<LI>I've looked at and used a number of different application frameworks. For the most
		part they're rather disapointing: most of them don't provide enough functionality,
		make poor use of abstractions, have weak error handling, and don't take full advantage
		of C++. You can find more details about these criticisms <A HREF="Description.html">here.</A></LI>
		
		<LI>I would like for Whisper to be better than even the platform specific frameworks.
		Despite the flaws I alluded to above this is a tough job: the other framework vendors
		have far more resources and they're not hampered by supporting multiple platforms.
		However I believe that Whisper can achieve this goal in time.</LI>
		
		<LI>Writing any framework is a big job let alone a cross platform framework. My hope is
		that if I provide a good start others will join in so that Whisper can evolve into
		a really sweet framework.</LI>

	<P>The Whisper release notes are <A HREF="Change%20History.html">here</A>.

	<P>I've setup a <A HREF="http://www.onelist.com/subscribe/whisper2">mailing list</A> at Onelist.com. This 
	is a company that maintains thousands of mailing lists for free. In return for this service they give advertisers 
	aggregate information about the members of the mailing lists and allow them to periodically post ads to the 
	mailing lists (you can also pay them to host the mailing lists if you want to remain ad free). 
	
	<P>Thomas Powers has been kind enough to make <A HREF="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</A> docs available at
	<A HREF="http://magnes.augsburg.edu/">here</A>.</P>
