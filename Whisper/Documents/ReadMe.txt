Whisper is a general purpose Mac/Windows C++ application framework. It's the succesorto the Mac framework Raven. Like Raven Whisper is a modern framework that takesadvantage of templates, multiple inheritance, STL, and exceptions. It's also designedaround the notion of Design by Contract and includes numerous debugging tools.There are a number of things I want to achieve with Whisper:* I want to make it as easy as possible to write cross platform apps. Ideally this would involve merely a recompile. (At my last company we essentially achieved this using a more specialized framework than Whisper).* I don't want to slight either platform: Whisper should be just as attractive toa Windows programmer as to a Mac programmer.* I've looked at and used a number of different application frameworks. For the mostpart they're rather disapointing: most of them don't provide enough functionality,make poor use of abstractions, have weak error handling, and don't take full advantageof C++. I intend for Whisper to do better in all these areas. :-)* I would like for Whisper to be better than even the platform specific frameworks.Despite the flaws I alluded to above this is a tough job: the other framework vendorshave far more resources and they're not hampered by supporting multiple platforms.However I believe that Whisper may achieve this goal in time.* Writing any framework is a big job let alone a cross platform framework. My hope isthat if I provide a good start others will join in so that Whisper can evolve intoa real kick-ass framework.Jesse Jonesjesjones@halcyon.com
