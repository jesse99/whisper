I consider Whisper 2.0 to be generally at late beta quality. There are some components that really need to be added (notably a visual layout tool), but I believe the design of the existing classes is generally sound and fairly well tested. However more real world experience is needed and additional testing on more system configurations is highly desirable.Some of Whisper is less finished than other pieces. I've listed these sectionsbelow. Development consists of code that is incomplete and may well changesignificantly in a later release. Alpha consists of code that needs further testing and may change somewhat. Beta consists of code that I'm generally happywith, but needs more use to ensure that the design an implementation are sound.Development:	* I had Whisper more or less working with Carbon quite some time ago, but I	  haven't done anything with it with the later CarbonLib builds. Getting	  Whisper working well with Carbon will be a high priority after I get Whisper	  2.0 out.	* All the UI code has been more or less completely rewritten to use COM. It's	  looking pretty good, but there may be some problems lurking. I also lost some	  important classes in the transition (like listboxes).Alpha:	* 		Beta:	* The Unicode and localization code looks good, but needs more testing to make	  sure that I haven't missed anything.	* The threading and synchronization classes may need some changes for Mac OS X.	* The Quesa stuff is derived from some old Raven code which was fairly well tested,	  but I've made a number of changes and the new code hasn't been stressed much.
