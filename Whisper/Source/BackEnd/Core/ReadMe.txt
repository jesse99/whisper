The Core project contains a variety of classes that are likely to be used by nearly
every Whisper app. These include broadcaster/listener mixins (ie the Observer pattern),
templatized wrappers around C function pointers/member function pointers, some STL
like continer classes, persistence and stream classes, a unicode string class, 
thread classes, and DOM-like XML classes (but the XML parser is in its own package).
