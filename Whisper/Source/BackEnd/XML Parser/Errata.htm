<h2>Known Errors</h2>



<dl>



<dt><a href="#sec-well-formed">Section 2.1</a> </dt>

<dd>In the list headed "Matching the document production implies that:",

the second list item has forward references to "start-tag" and "end-tag" which

need to be marked as defined terms.</dd>



<dt><a href="#charsets">Section 2.2</a></dt>

<dd>The sentence "Legal

characters are tab, carriage return, line feed, and the legal graphic

characters of Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646" is somewhat in conflict with

production [2] for <tt>Char</tt>, whose ranges include many character

positions that

are not yet defined by the Unicode/ISO 10646 standards.  Change the text to

make it clear that production [2] is normative; in practical terms this means

that newly-added characters such as the Euro (&amp;#x20ac; or &amp;#8364;)

are legal in XML documents.</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-prolog-dtd">Section 2.8</a></dt>

<dd>In production [24], the quotation-mark literals aren't quoted. Should be 

<tt>("'"&nbsp;VersionNum&nbsp;"'"&nbsp;|&nbsp;'"'&nbsp;VersionNum&nbsp;'"')</tt>

</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-prolog-dtd">Section 2.8</a></dt>

<dd>Just before production [28], the word "fuller" should be "further".</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-prolog-dtd">Section 2.8</a></dt>

<dd>To the paragraph before production [30], add 

"The external subset and any external

parameter entities referred to in the DTD must match the production

for <u>extPE</u>.  See <u>4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities</u>".</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-element-content">Section 3.2.1</a></dt>

<dd>The term "element content" needs to be marked as a formally defined

term.</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-element-content">Section 3.2.1</a></dt>

<dd>Change the word "parenthetized" to "parenthesized."</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-mixed-content">Section 3.2.2</a></dt>

<dd>

The name of the literal token  <tt>PCDATA</tt> has no justification.  Add to

the paragraph after production [51]: 'The keyword PCDATA derives historically

from the term 

"parsed character data."'

</dd>



<dt><a href="#attdecls">Section 3.3</a></dt>

<dd>The text "For interoperability, writers of DTDs may choose to provide at

most one attribute-list declaration for a given element type, at most one

attribute definition for a given attribute name, and at least one attribute 

definition in each attribute-list declaration." could be read as forbidding

more than one attribute of the same name in a DTD.  Change it to read

"For interoperability, writers of DTDs may choose to provide at

most one attribute-list declaration for a given element type, at most one

attribute definition for a given attribute name in an attribute-list

declaration, and at least one attribute definition in each attribute-list

declaration."</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-attribute-types">Section 3.3.1</a></dt>

<dd>Immediately before production [54], delete

', as noted:' and read '.  The validity constraints noted in the 

grammar are applied after the attribute value has been normalized as

described in <u>3.3 Attribute-List Declarations</u>'.</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-attribute-types">Section 3.3.1</a></dt>

<dd>The spec as written allows multiple attributes of type NOTATION on a

single element, which defeats the purpose; add a Validity Contraint to

production [58] as follows: "<b>Validity Constraint: One Notation per Element

Type</b>: No element type may have more than one NOTATION attribute

specified."</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-physical-struct">Section 4.</a></dt>

<dd>In the first sentence, the phrase "identified by name" should be

replaced by "identified by entity name".  Also, the phrase "see below"

should be removed, and phrase "document entity" made into a term-definition

link.</dd>



<dt><a href="#charencoding">Section 4.3.3</a></dt>

<dd>In the paragraph beginning "In the absence of information",

delete the phrase "for an encoding declaration to occur other than at the

beginning of an external entity".

Add a new paragraph after that one reading 

"It is an error for a TextDecl to occur other than at the beginning of

an external entity."</dd>



<dt><a href="#inliteral">Section 4.4.5</a></dt>

<dd>The first example has "&amp;YN;" - it should be "%YN;".</dd>



<dt><a href="#sec-notation">Section 6.</a></dt>

<dd>The notation used in Productions [13] (<tt>[-'()+,./:=?;!*#@$_%]</tt>) 

and [26] (<tt>[a-zA-Z0-9_.:]</tt>) is

not described in the notation section, although the semantics are

obvious.  Need to add descriptions to the first definition-list in the

Notation section.</dd>
