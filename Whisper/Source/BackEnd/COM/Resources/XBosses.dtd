<!-- In Microsoft's COM Whisper interfaces are typically mixed into one C++ object
and QueryInterface merely returns a pointer to one of the base classes. Whisper uses
a different model: each interface is typically implemented in a different C++ class
and interfaces are aggregated into "boss" objects.

This file defines the XML syntax used to specify the contents of bosses. You can
declare three types of boss objects: 1) normally you'll use the Boss element which
lets you list the interfaces in the boss 2) you can also use the AddInBoss element 
which lets you add new interfaces and/or replace the implementations in an existing 
boss (this makes plugins much more powerful) 3) finally you can use the AbstractBoss 
element to declare a boss that cannot be instantiated. This is useful because bosses 
can inherit the interfaces in other bosses. By using abstract bosses you can declare 
a common set of interfaces in one place.

Inside any of the bosses there are two elements you can use: 1) the Interface
element allows you to declare an interface by specifying the interface and implementation
names 2) the Parent elements allows you to pull in all the interfaces in another boss
(usually an abstract boss). -->
